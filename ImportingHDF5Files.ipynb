    "for Matrix Laboratory, is a numerical computing environment that is an industry standard in the disciplines of engineering and science. This is due in part to its powerful linear algebra and matrix capabilities, in part to its proprietary nature and in part to how difficult the academic world finds it to shake off old habits. Regardless of the reasons for its widespread use, the fact of the matter is that a lot of people use MATLAB and save their data as 'dot mat' files, the file format native to MATLAB. How can you import these into Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. SciPy to the rescue!\n",
    "00:38 - 00:50\n",

    "\n",
    "6. Importing a .mat file\n",
    "01:14 - 01:55\n",
    "Now this means when importing a dot mat file in Python, we should expect to see a number of different variables and objects. In this code, I first import scipy-dot-io and then load the file 'workspace dot mat'. Checking out what type of object results tells me that it's a dictionary. How this dictionary relates to a MATLAB workspace is straightforward: the keys of the Python dictionary are the MATLAB variable names and the values of the Python dictionary are the objects that are assigned to the variables. In the example above, mat['x'] is a numpy corresponding to the MATLAB array x in your MATLAB workspace. It's that easy.\n",

You can actually do it in 1 line, utilizing the pandas function read_sql_query and passing it 2 arguments. The first argument will be the query you wish to make, the 2nd argument the engine you want to connect to. And thus you can achieve the same as this code by executing this single line.
